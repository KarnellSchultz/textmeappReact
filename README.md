# TextMeApp

## Check out my project live on Glitch: https://smscolors.glitch.me/

Want to see the code : `https://glitch.com/edit/#!/smscolors`

This project app uses the Twilio API to allow users to send a text message to `+14257287345`, then have that text message edit the color of the pages background.

The app also uses Vue.js to display possible Css colors that users can use to update the page.

On the front-end,
public/
Index.html is the main html file
client.js is the client side JavaScript file

Server.js is the serverside node express Javascript code

using Twilio to send and receive SMS > also adding the content of the SMS to the html
